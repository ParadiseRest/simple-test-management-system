# Simple Test Management System

This repository contains a basic test management system created using spreadsheets. It is designed for managing and documenting test cases, tracking execution results, and maintaining a bug list for a small application.

## Contents:
1. **test_cases.xlsx**: A spreadsheet documenting the test cases, expected results, actual results, and their status.
2. **bug_tracking.xlsx**: A spreadsheet for tracking bugs, including their descriptions, severity, and status.
3. **summary.xlsx**: A summary of the testing process, highlighting the number of test cases, passed, failed, and bugs logged.

## How to Use:
- Download the spreadsheets to track your testing progress.
- Use `test_cases.xlsx` to add, update, and maintain test cases.
- Use `bug_tracking.xlsx` to log any bugs found during testing.
- Refer to `summary.xlsx` for a high-level overview of the testing process.
